# sas-macro-snippets
A collection of SAS macros and code snippets shared and collected by Health Care Policy (HCP) programmers

## Overview
The files in the repository are SAS macros and code snippets collected and created by analysts in the Deaprtment of Health Care Policy (HCP) at the Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA, USA. This collection started in the early 2000's. Many macros were downloaded from SAS conference papers and other institutional reposiories that granted permission to use and copy. All code is provided as is and you are free to use these in your SAS environments.

This repository was created in Febryuary 2023 as an alternative method to share HCP code. In November 2024, this repository replaces the  SAS macros in the SharePoint documents library. GitHub provides better methods to share, maintain, and use these macros going forward. A link to this repository has been included in the HCP Teams SharePoint site for the HCP analysts.

## Sharing Snippets
To share a code snippet, we recommend trying out [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com). Learn how to create a new Gist [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists).

## Macro Folders
The macro folder name indicates the general function of the macro. 
* **Data wrangling:** Anything to to with manipulating data, rows and variables
* **Function:** Short macros that work like a function, e.g., computing age, add a timestamp, removing quotes, etc... 
* **Method:** Various statistical methods and code to compute tables, statistics. SOme of the older macros may now actually have ben integrated into SAS/STAT procedures
* **Output and Formats:** Code to support graphical outpout, ODS, and other formatting options
* **Portability:** A set of macros that are useful for creating portable code, many created or modified from the SAS Global Forum paper 834-2017 by Art Carpenter and Mary Rosenbloom, Iâ€™ve Got to Hand It to You; Portable Programming Techniquesby 
* **Utility:** Basic utily functions that help get comon tasks done
