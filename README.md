# sas-macro-snippets
A collection of SAS macros and code snippets shared and collected by Health Care Policy (HCP) programmers

## Overview
The files in the repository are SAS macros and code snippets collected my many programes in the Deaprtment of Health Care Policy (HCP) at the Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA, USA. These useful macros and snippets were either created by HCP coders or downloaded and shared from other institutional  reposiories that granted permission to share. All code is provided as is and you are free to use these in your SAS environments.

This repository was created in Febryuary 2023 as an alternative method to share HCP code. Most of the SAS macros are still availabe in the private locations at HCP but snippets and macros added 2023 and later may only be availble here.

## Sharing Snippets
To share a code snippet, we recommend trying out [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com). Learn how to create a new Gist [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists).
