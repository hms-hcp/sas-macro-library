/ Program   : scanlog.sas
/ Version   : 1.2
/ Author    : Roland Rashleigh-Berry
/ Date      : 12-Oct-2009
/ Purpose   : To scan a sas log file for important messages
/ SubMacros : %qdequote
/ Notes     : This was written especially for sas programmers who develop their
/             programs interactively and use a "dm 'log; file ..." statement to
/             copy the contents of their log window to a file. After the copy is
/             done, this macro can be run to scan the log file created for all
/             important messages. It will write them to the log between an
/             obvious start and end line. This start and end line will always be
/             written, even if there are no messages, as proof that the scan was
/             done. If you wish to keep this output in the log then use 
/             "dm 'log; file ..." for a second time after running this macro.
/
/             You can either supply a full file name in quotes or an unquoted
/             fileref. See usage notes.
/
/ Usage     : %scanlog("full-file-path-name")
/             or
/             %scanlog(fileref)
